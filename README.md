# CNN for Stock Prediction using Keras

This is a Machine Learning project using Convolutional Neural Network to predict the stock price. It is a newly changed based on code by https://github.com/ZezhouLi.

The origin is done as a project article by Ashwin Siripurapu from Stanford University but in a different way.

## Getting Started

Use with Python 3.6 and Keras.
